The main purpose of this repository is to store proof-of-concept that I know how to create a debian 
package from source. From now on, if there's a way I can hack together something to make my first 
install of Debian/Ubuntu a cleaner one, I can use this package to setup all depenencies I have on 
the environment. :3

Mind-map/brainstorming:
Once this is all said and done, I'm going to have a series of installs within this one. The package 
dependency (unfortunately) is going to have to be global, so any package included in the list may 
not be consumed. Yes, this will cause a bit of bloat, but this should really only be installed on 
systems I totally control to start with. Later, I will worry about building custom packages for 
other systems I happen to have root with. They may only include changes to the home directory dot 
files.

Initially, I'm going to need my custom setup of XAMPP and I need to figure out how to get apt-get 
to ignore the use of the packages that they depend on. I want to build the dependencies only using 
the package manager and execute the pacakages themselves by custom source control I have in 
/home/XAMPP.

I'll also need custom .bashrc, .profile, and .alias files. They are essential to my environment 
being correct for the frequent commands I execute to make my life easier. Yes, there's some 
cleaning up to do in my current environment, but that's the point of setting this up :)
The potential for environment checks could be in place to ensure that only 
the appropriate variables are set and sent on each new shell.
